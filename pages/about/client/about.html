  	<h3>Brief Introduction to this web:</h3>

<br>
<div>
<p><h4>This web is created for rating Brandeis's faculty only.
The key feature is the "Comment Professors" page where one can enter some specific information about the 
course(s) he/she enrolled, and also write a personal view towards professors.
Note that in "Comment Results" page, one can search all the results by enter the 
faculty's name. For example, if "David" is the name being entered, every comments about 
him will be shown in that page. <br>
Aside from these features, one can see videos about professors in Brandeis to see the 
real class scenario. Lastly, our web provides users with a "Advice/Suggestions" page where they can
give advice for future improvement about this web.</h4></p>
