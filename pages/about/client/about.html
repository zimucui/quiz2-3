  	<h3>Brief Introduction to this web:</h3>
 </div>
<br>
<div>
<p><h4>This web is created for rating Brandeis's faculty only.
The key feature is the "ShowRating" page where one can enter some specific<br> information about the 
course(s) he/she enrolled, and also write a personal view towards professors.
Note that in "CommentResults"<br> page, one can search all the results by enter the 
faculty's name. For example, if "David" is the name being entered, every comments<br> about 
him will be shown in that page. 
Aside from these features, one can see videos about professors in Brandeis to see the 
real class<br> scenario. Lastly, our web provides users with a "Comments" page where they can
give advice for future improvement of this web.</h4></p>
